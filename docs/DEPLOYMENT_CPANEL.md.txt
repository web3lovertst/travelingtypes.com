# Deployment to cPanel

cPanel cannot be controlled directly by Cursor.

Deployment method:
1. Create a Git repository in cPanel.
2. Push your code from Cursor to GitHub.
3. Connect GitHub repo → cPanel Git deployment tool.
4. Auto-pull on each commit.

Alternative for Laravel on cPanel:
- backend in /backend
- public html points to /backend/public

Node apps cannot run permanently on standard cPanel; use:
- static export for Next.js
OR
- deploy Next.js on Vercel and backend on cPanel
